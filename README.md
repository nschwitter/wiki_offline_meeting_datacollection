# Collecting data on Wikipedia offline meetups

Offline face-to-face meetings are an important part of the Wikimedia community. However, there are only few systematic assessments of their effects of such meeting on online behaviour as it is difficult to obtain the meeting data.

This repo contains an example script for collecting meetup data of the Zurich community. For more information on how to collect meetup data, please see the learning pattern on Wikimedia here: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Learning_patterns/Collecting_data_on_offline_meetups. 

For more context on the project, please see the project grant page: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/nschwitter/The_Role_of_Offline_Ties_of_Wikipedians
